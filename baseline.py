NAIVE BASELINE  --  this is the state of the art without context.

It does exactly what everybody tries first: throw the raw DDL at an LLM,
ask for SQL, run it, print the result. No glossary, no process knowledge,
no tickets, no verification.

It works for trivial questions and fails badly on anything that requires
knowing what the data actually means. That failure is the point of this
case. Your job is to beat it.

Usage:
    python baseline.py
    python baseline.py "how many invoices are stuck in verification?"

Now go and check that answer against questions.md.

If it happens to be right, ask yourself whether it was right for the
right reason, or whether the model guessed and got lucky. Then try:

    python baseline.py "which vendors are blocked?"

Both of those have an obvious-looking answer that is wrong by a wide
margin. The information needed to get them right exists - it is in
context/, not in the schema.
